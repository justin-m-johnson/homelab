# NOTE
This project is under heavy construction as of July 2024. After a brief hiatus in the spring of 2024 due to work/life/hobby balance, I'm now resuming and making significant updates. Upcoming changes include documentation fixes, incorporating AI tools, and adding a Kubernetes cluster.

#  Project Description
Welcome to my Home Lab documentation! Here, I document my journey setting up my home lab using mostly free and open-source software. You can follow this documentation on [my personal website](https://www.justinmjohnson.com) and my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@initcyber) channel.

## Use Case
This repo documents my homelab and how I have it set up. It is under constant construction as I build, tear down, rebuild, automate, write it out as code (IAC: Terraform/Ansible), and figure out what works best for me and my lab environment.

## Updates

| Mid January 2024 | Added GitHub Actions workflow to upload logs to SIEM                                 |
| End January 2024 | 	Major script overhaul                                                               |
| Mid June 2024    | Homelab overhaul: Removed old node, added three new nodes, incorporated Ollama and OpenWebUI    |
| Early July 2024  | Reintroduced Terraform, replacing Ansible for IaC                                    |
| August 2024      | Restructured folders for better layout. Lower-cased everything except README.md      |
| September 2024   | Downsized lab - Too much power and not enough utilization currently, Implemented private repo to public repo push for self hosted github runners                  |
| December 2024    | Changed hardware in lab  |

# Implementation

#### terraform
Terraform will manage IaC, while Ansible will handle software and configuration provisioning post-Terraform application.

#### ansible
These scripts provision the VMs created by the terraform folder.

#### docker
This folder contains docker-compose.yml scripts for various VMs.


## Virtual Machine Requirements - Incomplete
(TBD)

# Putting it all together
(TBD)


# Future Updates
